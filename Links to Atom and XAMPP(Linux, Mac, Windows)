To install Atom Editor:

Linux  : https://flight-manual.atom.io/getting-started/sections/installing-atom/#platform-linux
Mac    : https://flight-manual.atom.io/getting-started/sections/installing-atom/#platform-mac
Windows: https://flight-manual.atom.io/getting-started/sections/installing-atom/#platform-windows

To test if Atom is closing tags automatically, create a new project,
new html file and then type:
"<html>" (without the double quotes)
It should automatically show this tag in the next line:
"</html>" (without the double quotes)

If not, I would recommend to install "close-tags" by "fauxparse"
To install it, go to Atom->Edit->Settings-> "+ Install" and type "close-tags". 

APACHE PHP & MYSQL PACKAGES(XAMPP):

Linux:

Install and configure APACHE2, PHP & MYSQL (Install those first):
https://hackernoon.com/how-to-install-and-configure-php-for-apache-and-mysql-wb1m33z1

After have installed APACHE2, PHP & MYSQL, install phpmyadmin:
https://www.hostinger.in/tutorials/how-to-install-and-setup-phpmyadmin-on-ubuntu

In case MYSQL throws a password error while setting up:

SIDE NOTE FOR XAMMP ON MAC/WINDOWS:

The installation process should be smooth, 
meaning you literally just need to click in "next" button to procede,
until the installation finishes.

I believe you can install both Atom Editor and XAMPP packages on your own, 
but if not, leave a comment down below

Always believe in your inner powers =D
